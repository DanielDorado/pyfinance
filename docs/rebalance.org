* Balancing Investments

After choosing a Portfolio you should adjust it regularly to:

1. Align your Portfolio with your objectives (maintain the desired level of assets).
2. Increment its profitability of it, because you sell when high and buy when down.
 
*Consider Costs and Taxes!*. Take into account if you can tax-free and commission-free transfer money among funds.

* How to Rebalance

The data needed:

- For each asset (index fund for example):
  - Asset Name
  - Percentage
  - Value (shares * price per share)
- Threshold, when exceeded for an asset rebalance it.

What is it good threshold? Between 5% and 10%, the more the riskier.
